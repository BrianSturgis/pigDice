## SPECS

Test: "It should create an empty array called numberRange"

Expect:(numberRange).toEqual([]);

Test: "loops through inputted number and checks if a range of numbers starting at inputted number includes a string with "3" in it"
Expect:(numberRange).toEqual(["3"]);

Test: "if a number range from the number given to zero is "3" then three will br replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

## Stretch goals
- Images, styling, and custom animations used in UI.
- Implement different behaviors/effects/images for different inputs.
- Include an option that returns the output in reversed order (beginning with the largest number).
- Add a second form field that takes a name as an input. Then update the output so that the program states "Won't you be my neighbor, [name]?" instead of "Won't you be my neighbor?"
- Animated UI
- Unity driven UI
- Adobe DSP workflow fully integrated
