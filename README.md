<p align="center">PIG DICE</p>

## Application Description
Pig Dice is a simple dice game where Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.  As with many games of folk origin, Pig Dice is played with many rule variations, including the use of two dice instead of one. 

Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games", where the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains.
